# Summary of steps
1. Install gdown
2. Download the c8000v image to `6-network_upgrade_as_code` and push to gitea
3. Move the c8000v image out of the repo when done. (Important!!!)
4. Run the Network-Upgrade-Workflow template and choose image and approve the upgrade
6. Review the Network-Upgrade-Upgrade job-template

## Objective
To stage firmware images and upgrade network devices with Ansible. Please note it takes several minutes to both stage files and upgrade.   

## Overview
Software Image Management (SWIM) is a repeatable framework where engineers can produce repeatable, safe outcomes for efficient device software upgrades. This results in a faster response to vulnerability management, more predictable maintenance schedules, and hours of an engineerâ€™s life saved in the middle of the night.

Ansible can scp firmware images to network devices. The workflow includes an approval node to control when an upgrade will be activated based on change control. 

## Main Points
In this exercise you will use the following:
- ansible.netcommon.netput module to push files with scp
- cisco.ios.ios_command module with prompts to interact with the CLI upgrade process

### Step 1 - Install gdown
Install gdown
~~~
pip install gdown
~~~

### Step 2 - Download Images
From the folder `6-network_upgrade_as_code/`

1. gdown
~~~
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cPPO1mxIZf4weIi497r3ffGC5g0_S58i
~~~

2. Push to gitea repo
This way the image files will be available for Ansible. Normally we would store these image files on a server instead of the git repo.
Complete the git steps for your change. You must save, commit the file in the VSCode IDE and "sync" push to gitea after fixing the file.
![Save](../../images/save_commit.png)

or update from the terminal
~~~
git add --all
git commit -m "deploy"
git push
~~~
### Step 3 - Run the Network-Upgrade-Workflow

This will take a few minutes due to the file size.
1. Run the Network-Upgrade-Workflow template to stage the image.
Select the following when prompted for the staging and upgrade file 
~~~
17.15.01a
~~~

2. Review the staging output and `6-network_upgrade_as_code/staging.yml` playbook.

output:
~~~

~~~

### Step 4 - Move Image
 Move the image file out of the network-demos-repo to the home directory
#### It's important to move the image file otherwise, the repo in Gitea could fail on future tasks. 

 mv the file
~~~
mv c8000v-universalk9.17.15.01a.SPA.bin /home/student
~~~
2. Push to gitea repo
This way the image files will no longer be in the repo.
Complete the git steps for your change. You must save, commit the file in the VSCode IDE and "sync" push to gitea after fixing the file.
![Save](../../images/save_commit.png)

or update from the terminal
~~~
git add --all
git commit -m "deploy"
git push
~~~
### Step 5 - Return to the Workflow
At this time the Network-Upgrade-Workflow job is waiting for someone to approve the upgrade.

##### Remember to return to the AAP JOB for the Workflow and accept the approval node
![approve](../images/approveupgrade.png)

### Step 6 - Review the Network-Upgrade-Upgrade Job-Template output

# Key Takeaways
* Ansible can scp firmware images to network devices. `netcommon.net_put` 
* Approval nodes can control when an upgrade will be activated based on change control. 
* Assertions to validate a functioning pre and post upgrade device
